Enable "Accessible Terminal" in Workspace Settings to use a screen reader with the shell.
Update gateway configuration to allow external connections
gateway is not working, the approved pending code was for 9033875220 and not 3405140344

what about the native ui, it is not puling up either

Right — both the native OpenClaw Control UI and SSH are timing out because the VPS is not reachable from outside right now. The screenshot you showed earlier confirmed it: 187.77.192.215 took too long to respond (and that was also the wrong IP).

Everything points to the same root cause: the VPS is currently not accepting incoming connections on any port (SSH, HTTP, or WebSocket). This is a VPS-level networking issue.

The only way to fix this is through the Hostinger control panel, which connects directly to the server (bypasses the network):

Go to hpanel.hostinger.com
Click on your VPS srv1378355
Click "Browser terminal" (it's usually on the overview page or under a "Console" or "Terminal" button)
Once you see the terminal prompt, run:
ufw status
This will show if the firewall is blocking connections. If ports 18789 and 22 aren't listed as allowed, run:

ufw allow 22
ufw allow 18789
ufw reload
Then check if the gateway is running:

systemctl --user status openclaw-gateway
If it's stopped, start it:

openclaw gateway restart
The Hostinger browser terminal is your lifeline when SSH and all ports are unreachable — it always works regardless of firewall settings. Let me know what you see once you're in!

The gateway is running (active, green dot, v2026.2.15). And the firewall says "not enabled" — so no ports are being blocked.

I notice something important: the hostname is srv1390515, not srv1378355 as before. This might be a different VPS or it was reprovisioned. Also the version is v2026.2.15 instead of 2026.2.19-2.

Since the gateway is running and the firewall is off, the native UI should be accessible. But first — what's the actual IP of this VPS? Run this in the Hostinger terminal:

curl -4 ifconfig.me
This will show the public IP address. It might have changed from 187.77.194.205. Share what it shows!

Also try accessing the native UI directly from the VPS itself to confirm it works:

curl -s http://127.0.0.1:18789 | head -5
I see the problem! You're still using the old wrong IP (187.77.192.215) and the old wrong token (b9ccc06b...). Those are both outdated.

The correct values are:

IP: 72.60.167.64 (what we just confirmed from curl ifconfig.me)
Port: 18789
First, get the correct token. Run this on the Hostinger terminal:

grep OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN ~/.config/systemd/user/openclaw-gateway.service
Then to connect a node, use the correct IP:

openclaw node run --host 72.60.167.64 --port 18789
Don't use 187.77.192.215 — that's the old IP that no longer works. Your VPS public IP changed to 72.60.167.64.

did we have our ui update for the link to the native ui will work?

http://72.60.167.64:18789 this is not working

The gateway is running but it's bound to loopback (127.0.0.1 only), so it won't accept connections from your browser. You need to change it to listen on all interfaces. Run this on the Hostinger terminal:

openclaw config set gateway.bind lan
openclaw gateway install --force
openclaw gateway restart
Wait 5 seconds, then try http://72.60.167.64:18789 again in your browser.

The gateway was set to loopback earlier to fix the CLI security error — but that also blocks external browser access. Setting it to lan makes it accessible from outside.

incognitio and still not connecting to the gateway

The native OpenClaw Control UI is loading at the correct IP (72.60.167.64:18789). It shows the WebSocket URL is correct (ws://72.60.167.64:18789) but the token is wrong — it's showing the old token b9ccc06b....

The status shows "disconnected (1006): no reason" which means the WebSocket connected but the token didn't match. You need to put the correct token in the Gateway Token field.

On the Hostinger terminal, run:

grep OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN ~/.config/systemd/user/openclaw-gateway.service
Then:

Copy that token
Paste it into the "Gateway Token" field in the native UI (replacing the old b9ccc06b... one)
Click "Connect"
That should bring it online. Share the token here too and I'll update our dashboard database so everything matches.

I see two things happening:

The pairing code approval is failing — you entered 29DBC48 but the full code from WhatsApp is 29DBC489. You're missing the last digit 9. Try approving with the full code: 29DBC489

The phone number +19033875220 is showing up — this is a real pending WhatsApp user who messaged the bot. That's actually working correctly! The bot received a message from that number and generated a pairing code.

Try entering the complete pairing code 29DBC489 (all 8 characters) and click Approve again.

this has the wrong phone number +13405140344 is the right number

yes

ok so how do I add this computer as a node?

To add your computer as a node, you first need to get the correct gateway token from this VPS. On the Hostinger terminal, run:

grep OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN ~/.config/systemd/user/openclaw-gateway.service
Copy that token. Then on your computer (not the VPS), open a terminal and run:

npm install -g openclaw
Then connect as a node:

export OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN=<PASTE_THE_TOKEN_HERE>
openclaw node run --host 72.60.167.64 --port 18789
Replace <PASTE_THE_TOKEN_HERE> with the actual token from the grep command.

If you haven't installed OpenClaw on your computer yet, you'll need Node.js 18+ installed first. Then the npm install -g openclaw command will set it up.

Want me to walk you through any of these steps?

PS C:\WINDOWS\system32> npm install -g openclaw
npm : The term 'npm' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable
program. Check the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct
and try again.
At line:1 char:1

npm install -g openclaw
  + CategoryInfo          : ObjectNotFound: (npm:String) [], CommandNotFoundException
  + FullyQualifiedErrorId : CommandNotFoundException
PS C:\WINDOWS\system32>

You need to install Node.js on your Windows computer first. Here's the easiest way:

Go to https://nodejs.org
Download the LTS version (the big green button)
Run the installer — just click Next through everything, keep all defaults
Close and reopen PowerShell after the install finishes
Then try again:

npm install -g openclaw
Once that works, you can connect as a node. But first get the token from the Hostinger terminal:

grep OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN ~/.config/systemd/user/openclaw-gateway.service
Then back on your Windows PowerShell:

$env:OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN="<PASTE_TOKEN_HERE>"
openclaw node run --host 72.60.167.64 --port 18789
(On Windows PowerShell, you use $env: instead of export to set environment variables.)

+ FullyQualifiedErrorId : CommandNotFoundException
PS C:\WINDOWS\system32> openclaw node run --host 72.60.167.64 --port 18789

  + FullyQualifiedErrorId : CommandNotFoundException
You installed Node.js but OpenClaw isn't installed yet. You need to install it first. Run this:

npm install -g openclaw
Then after that finishes, run:

openclaw node run --host 72.60.167.64 --port 18789
If npm still isn't recognized, close PowerShell completely and reopen it — Node.js needs a fresh terminal after installation.

PowerShell is blocking scripts for security. You need to allow it first. Run this command:

Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
It will ask you to confirm — type Y and press Enter.

Then try again:

npm install -g openclaw
ok its running, whats next?

Now connect your computer as a node. Run these in PowerShell:

$env:OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN="b9ccc06bc2a8a6daecc395ee883b1673e82ac2f9884fd138"
openclaw node run --host 72.60.167.64 --port 18789
This will connect your Windows computer to the gateway as a processing node. You should see it connect and show up as an active node. Let me know what it shows!

The npm install -g openclaw had errors — OpenClaw didn't install properly. Let's try a different approach. Close PowerShell and reopen it, then try:

npx openclaw node run --host 72.60.167.64 --port 18789
npx will download and run OpenClaw without needing a global install. It will ask you to confirm the download — type y and press Enter.

Make sure to set the token first:

$env:OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN="b9ccc06bc2a8a6daecc395ee883b1673e82ac2f9884fd138"
npx openclaw node run --host 72.60.167.64 --port 18789
I see two things:

The native UI shows "disconnected (1006)" — this is the token mismatch. Click in the Gateway Token field, clear it, paste the correct token b9ccc06bc2a8a6daecc395ee883b1673e82ac2f9884fd138, and click Connect.

The node connection on the VPS is hitting the same security error — SECURITY ERROR: Cannot connect to "72.60.167.64" over plaintext ws://. Since you're running the node command on the VPS itself, use 127.0.0.1 instead. On the Hostinger terminal, run:

npx openclaw node run --host 127.0.0.1 --port 18789
This avoids the security error because it's connecting locally. The ws:// security restriction only applies to non-loopback addresses.

For connecting your Windows computer as a node — we need to get OpenClaw installed first. Let's go back to your Windows PowerShell:

npx openclaw node run --host 72.60.167.64 --port 18789
Did this work on your Windows machine, or did you only try it on the VPS?

still going to 9033875220

The error is npm error code ENOENT with syscall spawn git — your Windows machine doesn't have Git installed, which npx openclaw needs to download and set up.

You have two options:

Option 1: Install Git on Windows (recommended)

Go to https://git-scm.com/download/win
Download and install Git
Close and reopen PowerShell
Then try again:
$env:OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN="b9ccc06bc2a8a6daecc395ee883b1673e82ac2f9884fd138"
npx openclaw node run --host 72.60.167.64 --port 18789
Option 2: Skip the Windows node for now and use the VPS itself as a node
On your Hostinger terminal, run:

export OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN=b9ccc06bc2a8a6daecc395ee883b1673e82ac2f9884fd138
npx openclaw node run --host 127.0.0.1 --port 18789
This makes the VPS act as both the gateway and a processing node. Using 127.0.0.1 avoids the plaintext security error since it's connecting locally.

Which would you prefer?

Same error — your Windows machine needs Git installed. The OpenClaw package has a dependency that requires Git to download.

Install Git now:

Go to https://git-scm.com/download/win
Click the download link — it should auto-detect 64-bit
Run the installer — you can accept all the default settings
Once installed, close PowerShell completely and reopen it
Then run these commands again:
$env:OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN="b9ccc06bc2a8a6daecc395ee883b1673e82ac2f9884fd138"
npx openclaw node run --host 72.60.167.64 --port 18789
Without Git installed, npx can't download the OpenClaw package. Let me know once Git is installed and you try again!

ok its installed

Git is installed. Now close PowerShell and reopen it, then run:

$env:OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN="b9ccc06bc2a8a6daecc395ee883b1673e82ac2f9884fd138"
npx openclaw node run --host 72.60.167.64 --port 18789
It should download OpenClaw successfully this time and connect your computer as a node. Let me know what you see!

I see two things from this screenshot:

WhatsApp Bot is showing Connected with the correct number +13405140344 — that's working.

Gateway connection shows a 502 error — "Could not reach the gateway server." This means the OpenClaw gateway on your VPS might not be running right now. You need to check on the Hostinger terminal if OpenClaw is still running.

On your Hostinger terminal, run:

openclaw gateway status
If it's not running, start it:

openclaw gateway start
Once the gateway is back up, click Check Connection again on the dashboard.

Also — did the npx openclaw node run command work on your Windows PowerShell after installing Git?

I see the issue — the gateway is set to bind=loopback (127.0.0.1) which means only local clients can connect. That's why our dashboard (connecting from outside) gets a 502 error.

You need to change it to "lan" mode so external connections work. On the Hostinger terminal, run:

openclaw gateway bind lan
openclaw gateway restart
This will make the gateway listen on all interfaces so our dashboard and your Windows node can connect to it. After running those commands, click Check Connection on the dashboard again.

I see the openclaw gateway bind lan command gave an error about too many arguments, but then openclaw gateway restart succeeded. The bind might not have actually changed. Let me check — the status still showed bind=loopback.

Try this instead — edit the config file directly:

nano ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json
Find the "bind" setting and change it from "loopback" to "lan". Save the file (Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter), then restart:

openclaw gateway restart
After restarting, verify with:

openclaw gateway status
It should now show bind=lan instead of bind=loopback. That will allow our dashboard and your Windows node to connect.

Good, you're in the config file. Now scroll down to find the "gateway" section. Press Ctrl+W (Where Is) and type gateway to search for it. You're looking for something like:

"gateway": {
  "bind": "loopback",
  ...
}
Change "loopback" to "lan". If there's no "gateway" section, scroll to the end (before the final }) and add:

"gateway": {
  "bind": "lan"
}
