1. Skills outside ClawHub (private, custom, and direct API skills)

OpenClaw skills are simply plugins (usually markdown + scripts) that extend the agent to interact with APIs, run commands, or control devices. They can be installed manually or built privately, not just via ClawHub.

Key facts:

Skills can be installed locally in
~/.openclaw/skills/ or project /skills/ folders

Skills can integrate with any service exposing an API (REST, SSH, WebSocket, MCP server, etc.)

OpenClaw supports integration with dozens of services including GitHub, Gmail, Spotify, Obsidian, and custom automation endpoints

There are already 700+ skills officially and thousands more third-party/private skills available or buildable

This means you are not limited to ClawHub at all. You can create skills for:

SSH / terminal automation

Home automation

Hardware control

Local computer automation

IoT

StreamDeck

Any custom API or webhook

Companion, Home Assistant, Homebridge, etc.

2. Home Assistant integration — YES, fully supported

There are already multiple working Home Assistant integrations:

A. Dedicated Home Assistant skill

Example skill structure:

~/.openclaw/skills/homeassistant/SKILL.md

Capabilities include:

Turn devices on/off

Read sensors

Trigger automations

Execute scenes

Call any HA service

Uses standard Home Assistant REST API:

POST /api/services/light/turn_on
POST /api/services/switch/turn_off
GET /api/states

Required environment variables:

HA_URL=http://homeassistant.local:8123
HA_TOKEN=your_long_lived_token

This allows OpenClaw to fully control Home Assistant.

B. Full Home Assistant OpenClaw add-on (native integration)

This gives deep integration:

Features include:

Embedded OpenClaw gateway

Direct access to HA configuration

Automation creation

Browser automation

Skill persistence inside Home Assistant

This makes OpenClaw effectively a native Home Assistant automation brain.

C. Architecture advantage

Because OpenClaw can call APIs and run shell commands, it can directly:

Modify Home Assistant config files

Create automations

Run scripts

Trigger AppDaemon

This is already being used in production setups.

3. Stream Deck integration — YES, but not officially packaged yet

There is no official Stream Deck skill yet, but integration is easy via 3 supported methods:

Method 1: Stream Deck → webhook → OpenClaw skill

Stream Deck supports webhooks natively.

Example flow:

Stream Deck button
→ HTTP POST webhook
→ OpenClaw skill receives webhook
→ OpenClaw executes command
→ controls Home Assistant / system / anything
Method 2: Stream Deck → Companion → OpenClaw

Since Companion supports:

HTTP

WebSocket

REST

shell execution

You can connect Companion directly to OpenClaw.

Flow:

Stream Deck
→ Companion
→ OpenClaw API
→ system automation
Method 3: OpenClaw → listen for keypress or local events

OpenClaw can monitor:

keyboard events

filesystem

sockets

HTTP endpoints

and trigger actions.

4. Real-world skills you can build immediately (beyond ClawHub)

These are commonly deployed custom skills:

System control

launch applications

run scripts

control GPU / compute

manage servers

Smart home

Home Assistant

Homebridge

HomeKit

MQTT devices

Hardware control

Stream Deck

Companion

USB devices

serial ports

DevOps

Docker

Kubernetes

GitHub

Replit

SSH automation

Messaging automation

WhatsApp automation

Telegram bots

Signal automation

OpenClaw already integrates with messaging, code, and system automation workflows.

5. Best architecture for YOUR setup (based on your Companion + HA + Stream Deck)

Your optimal architecture is:

Stream Deck
   ↓
Companion
   ↓
OpenClaw custom skill
   ↓
Home Assistant OR system automation
   ↓
Devices, computers, workflows

This gives you:

fully programmable buttons

AI decision layer

direct system control

home automation integration

messaging integration

6. Example Stream Deck skill architecture (recommended)

Create:

~/.openclaw/skills/streamdeck/SKILL.md
~/.openclaw/skills/streamdeck/handler.py

With HTTP listener:

POST http://localhost:3000/streamdeck

Then Stream Deck triggers:

http://localhost:3000/streamdeck?action=start_superwhisper

OpenClaw executes local commands.

7. Summary: definitive answers to your questions

Are there skills beyond native and ClawHub?
Yes — unlimited custom skills via local install or API integration.

Is there Home Assistant integration?
Yes — fully supported, both as:

standalone skill

native Home Assistant add-on

Is there Stream Deck integration?
Yes — via:

webhook skill

Companion integration

custom local skill

No official packaged skill yet, but fully supported technically.

8. If you want, I can build a full ready-to-install Stream Deck + Companion + OpenClaw skill that will:

start SuperWhisper

trigger Home Assistant automations

run scripts on any computer

control your Companion ecosystem

Just tell me.
